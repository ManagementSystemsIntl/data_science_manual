# Summary

First and foremost, MSI is client driven. We provide what is asked for, following client guidance. Within this framework, we use a variety of analytical approaches and tools that follow best practice while satisfying the guidance we are under.

This manual provides an idealized approach of a data analysis. MSI is agnostic about the tools used to conduct an analysis, but the majority of explanation and examples are provided in the R programming language.

In unit one, we introduce R, explain how it works, and provide guidance as to how to get set up and start analyzing.

In unit two, we go through the steps of a data analysis.

In unit three, we review different ways to report your analyses.

Throughout the journey, we will provide examples of MSI analyses that were used for internal learning, or to generate a client deliverable.

Let's start!
